# Digit-Classification-Using-SVD-and-Multiple-Distance-Metrics
This code implements a digit classification system that uses datasets (USPS and a custom dataset referred to as "Garbled Gradient") and applies various classification methods (Cosine Similarity, Euclidean Distance, and SVD-based methods) to evaluate the accuracy of predictions.
